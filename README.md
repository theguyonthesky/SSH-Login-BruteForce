# SSH Login BruteForce üîê

# Overview
The SSH Brute-Force Script is a Python-based tool designed to automate the process of testing a list of commonly used passwords against an SSH server. It uses the powerful pwntools library along with paramiko to attempt logins on a specified host and username. The goal is to identify valid credentials during penetration testing or in educational lab environments.

# Note
- Security and Ethical Notice: This script is intended for educational and ethical hacking purposes only. It must only be used in environments you own or have explicit permission to test. Do not use the provided code and techniques for illegal activities.
  
# Features
- Password List Reading: Reads passwords from a wordlist (top20ssh-common-passwords.txt)
- Automated SSH Attempts: Iteratively attempts SSH logins against a specified host and user
- Success Detection: Detects successful login and displays the correct password
- Error Handling: Handles authentication failures 
- Timeout Configuration: Configurable timeout to keep attempts responsive and avoid long delays
  
# How It Works
1. The script reads a password list file line by line.
2. For each password:
   - Attempts an SSH login using the `ssh()` method from `pwntools`.
   - If successful, prints the valid password and exits.
   - If login fails (triggering a `paramiko.AuthenticationException`, which is used under the hood by `pwntools`), it continues to the next password.
3. Tracks and displays the number of attempts made.

# Files
- `ShellCodeLoader.cpp`: Contains the C++ code for the shellcode loader, involving dynamic API call resolution, AES decryption, and shellcode execution in a newly allocated memory region. Please reference this file for a detailed code walkthrough.
- `ShellCodeYara.yara`: A YARA rule designed to detect the presence or usage of the provided shellcode loader in analyzed files or memory, targeting API calls and characteristic strings.

# How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Set up dependencies and compile
    - ## Shellcode Loader
    - Dependencies: Requires a C++ compiler (e.g., MinGW, Visual Studio)
    - Compilation: Compile `ShellCodeLoader.cpp` using a C++ compiler targeting the intended architecture (32/64 bit) with: <br>g++ ShellCodeLoader.cpp -o ShellCodeLoader.exe -lcrypt32 -ladvapi32 <br>Or use the Run button in your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio) to compile and run the program.
  
    - ## YARA Rule
    - Dependencies: Install YARA: Refer to the official YARA documentation for installation and usage details.
    - Usage: Utilize ShellCodeYara.yara to scan files or memory for indications of the shellcode loader using: yara -r ShellCodeYara.yara [directory or file to scan]
